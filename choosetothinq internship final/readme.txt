Respected Sir,
Here are the things needed to deploy it:-

1. You need to have apache server with python enabled and also python installed on the system.Also MySQL needs to be installed.
2. First put all the files present in the html folder in your apache html folder
3. Then put all the files in cgi-bin folder in your apache cgi-bin folder and provide neccessary permissions.
4. Create a database "choosetothinq" in mysql and import the choosetothinq.sql in the database using phpmyadmin
5. For administrator access:-
	username:- admin@webmaster.com
	password:- admin12345
6.For uploading the .txt, .sql,.xml files for questions put the files in the cgi-bin folder in the format as already provided in the cgi-bin folder.
